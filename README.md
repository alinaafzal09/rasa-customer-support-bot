“Rasa-based chatbot with custom actions”
# 🧠 Rasa Customer Support Bot

This is my first AI chatbot project built using **Rasa**, where I explored how conversational AI works from the inside — without using any external AI APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face.

The goal was **not to deploy or sell**, but to understand the **backend logic** of chatbots — like how NLU (Natural Language Understanding), rule-based training, and custom actions work.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How Rasa handles intents, entities, and responses using `nlu.yml`, `stories.yml`, and `rules.yml`
- Building a rule-based chatbot using **NLU pipelines**
- Writing simple **custom actions in Python**
- Connecting actions using `endpoints.yml`
- Running the chatbot locally using Rasa CLI

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Rasa Open Source**
- **Python**
- No external AI APIs used — full local processing

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- This is a **learning project** only.
- Not connected to a live domain or real dataset.
- No sensitive data included — `__pycache__` is ignored, and credentials are not committed.

---

##  Next Steps

In upcoming projects, I’ll be:
- Using **LangChain**, **FastAPI**, and **Hugging Face**
- Deploying bots with real UI
- Exploring LLM agents & more advanced pipelines

Stay tuned..
